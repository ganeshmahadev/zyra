# ðŸ”§ Zyra Tool Execution - Fixed and Working!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Tool Call Pattern Matching**
- **Before**: Only supported ````tool toolName` format  
- **After**: Supports both ````tool:toolName` and ````tool toolName` formats
- **Result**: AI responses are now properly parsed for tool calls

### 2. **Enhanced Tool Execution Feedback** 
- **Before**: Basic success/failure messages
- **After**: Detailed feedback with file paths, sizes, previews, and command outputs
- **Result**: You can now see exactly what tools are doing

### 3. **Improved System Prompt**
- **Before**: Generic instructions about tool usage
- **After**: Clear, specific format with examples and emphasis on MUST use tools
- **Result**: AI providers are more likely to use the correct tool format

### 4. **Better Error Detection**
- **Before**: Silent failures when tools should be used but weren't  
- **After**: Detects when AI mentions file operations but doesn't use tools
- **Result**: You'll know when the AI should have used tools but didn't

## How to Test Tool Execution

### 1. Start Zyra REPL
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or: node bin/zyra.js repl
```

### 2. Test Commands That Should Trigger Tools

**File Creation:**
```
"Create a file called hello.js with console.log('Hello World')"
```

**Directory Listing:**
```
"List the files in the current directory"  
```

**File Reading:**
```
"Read the contents of package.json"
```

**Terminal Commands:**
```
"Run the command 'pwd' to show current directory"
```

### 3. What You Should See

When tools execute properly, you'll see:

```
ðŸ”§ Executing tool: createFile
ðŸ“¥ Input: {
  "path": "hello.js", 
  "content": "console.log('Hello World');"
}

âœ… Tool 'createFile' executed successfully
   ðŸ“„ Created: /Users/ganesh/zyra/hello.js

---
ðŸ”§ Tool Execution Results:
âœ… Tool 'createFile' executed successfully
   ðŸ“„ Created: /Users/ganesh/zyra/hello.js
```

## Tool Format for AI

The AI should now respond with:

```tool:createFile
{
  "path": "example.js",
  "content": "// Your code here"
}
```

## Available Tools

1. **createFile** - Create new files
2. **readFile** - Read file contents  
3. **editFile** - Modify existing files
4. **deleteFile** - Remove files
5. **listDir** - List directory contents
6. **fileSearch** - Search for files by name
7. **grepSearch** - Search file contents
8. **bash** - Execute terminal commands

## Verification

The fixes have been tested and confirmed working:
- âœ… Tool parsing works correctly
- âœ… File operations create actual files in filesystem  
- âœ… Directory listings show real directory contents
- âœ… Terminal commands execute and return output
- âœ… Detailed feedback shows exactly what happened

Your Zyra CLI agent will now properly execute file operations, show you the results, and make actual changes to your filesystem when requested!
